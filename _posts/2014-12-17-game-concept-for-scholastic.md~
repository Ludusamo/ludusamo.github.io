##Where it began.
Because the STEM challenge originally was a competition about STEM concepts, I thought about making a game about the science that I am currently most interested in: computer science. However, a couple issues arise:

- Comp Sci games usually become modding games.
- The programming becomes more prevalent than gameplay.
- Can become frustrating very quickly.

So, in the beginning I just scrapped the comp sci idea and just tried to find another idea. But then, an idea hit me. 

##Concept 
The concept I came up with spawns off of the Hacker series of game mechanics on [Three Hundred Game Mechanics](http://www.squidi.net/three/c_compgrid.php) by Sean Howard. I wanted to make a similar concept that would be inside a computer so kinda like this hack idea, but it would be following a little character which would be a representation of a program.
