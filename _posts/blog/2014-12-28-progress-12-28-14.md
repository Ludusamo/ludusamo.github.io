## Today's Progress
Oh boy did we get a lot done today. Not quite as much as I wanted to from yesterday, but quite a bit.
<!--more-->

## Issues
As far as coding goes, today went pretty smoothly. Threw a lot of things together in a short span of time, so if bugs arise in the future, well there is a good chance that they came from today. But that's an issue for another day. Today we gotta fight a fast approaching deadline.

## Tasks Completed
Today I:

- Implemented a pause menu with save, resume, and quit functionality
- Implemented 2 of the foreseeable 3 dialog types (message and character dialog)
- Implemented a couple more animations
- Minor bug fixes

The save function as of right now only takes in the players position and loads everything else the same. However, this leaves room for the save functionality to be expanded in the future.

This is a short gif of today's progress:

So I didn't finish everything I wanted to finish today, but it was good progress. Tomorrow I am going to spearhead NPCs and begin to program in one of the main tropes of the game which is the programming interface for our character. Once that is done, I can begin to move forward on level design and hopefully begin to flesh out the game. Assuming there are no issues, but there **_always_** will be. Until next time.
