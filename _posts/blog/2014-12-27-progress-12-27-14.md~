## Today's Progress
So, I am starting to realize how fast the deadline is approaching. I gotta pick up my game fast... Today animations were completed.
<!--more-->

## Issues
No issues to report today besides minor issue with alpha appearing as black when rendered by OpenGL. Fixed simply by enabling OpenGL blending.

Collision still slightly bad, but we will work with it and move forward due to time restraints.

## Tasks Completed
Today I:

- Got rid of the annoying black behind our character
- Did a couple quick fixes for the collision
- Implemented animations

Tomorrow I want to really make some progress. So I am setting the goal of doing dialog boxes and NPCs. And then we gotta make it such that we can begin to program our little character. But that will require making a menu too. This may be a bit ambitious. But we gotta move.
