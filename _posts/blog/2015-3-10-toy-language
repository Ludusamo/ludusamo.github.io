## Hi there
This is my first blog post in a while. I will probably make another soon with an update to what happen with my game for the Scholastic Challenge. Today I am announcing another project that I am working on.
<!--more-->

## What am I up to?
I am starting a new little project that basically entails me creating a simple scripting language. I am not planning on doing anything too fancy with it.
I was simply playing around with the [Godot Engine](https://www.godotengine.org), which I highly recommend, I saw that they had implemented their own scripting language, and I wondered how hard it was to create one.
So, I poked around a bit and I saw that there is not a whole ton of resources/tutorials on it. The ones that I did find bored me a little bit so I just decided to try making one from scratch.
Its not going to be the most efficient language, but I think of it as a little fun challenge for myself. I will probably make further posts on the progress in the future.

##Other News
I have been looking into electromyography (EMG) as a form of signal to use for a controller. I recently bought a sensor parts from [Bitalino](https://www.bitalino.com). More on this in the future.
