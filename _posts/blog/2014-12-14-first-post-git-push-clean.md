##Hello Everyone!
This is my first blog post since creating this.
<!

The aim of this blog is to create a place where I can log and document my thoughts, ideas, and work. Definitely more of a personal development kind of thing. I hope to share things that I want to talk about on here.

Some things about me:

- I am a student that is interested in computer science.
- I spend time making video games for fun.
- I also love playing them!
- I love to create experiences that are fun for everyone!

This post is also somewhat of a test. Everything on the site as of right now is still under construction, but hopefully progress will be made and this website will slowly become something special and unique.

Anyway, until next time!~

- Brendan
