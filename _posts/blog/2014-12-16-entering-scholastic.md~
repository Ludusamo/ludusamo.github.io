##I am in!
I decided I would try my hand at entering the [Scholastic competition](http://www.artandwriting.org) for art under the game programming division.

My friend had mentioned it to me that I could enter my game that I was working on for the [STEM Competition](http://www.stemchallenge.org) in February for this competition as well if I just sped up my timeline. I think that this will be a good way to get me to stop procrastinating on this and just move forward with it. I have details on the kind of game that I will be making, but I will release more on this in the future. I plan on putting my plans and progress into this blog almost as a diary entry, but for now this is all. I will come back in the near future (probably tomorrow) and start talking about my plans.
