####Question Lock
The question lock is an application for Android devices which replaces or supplements the lock screen. In order to unlock the phone, the user must answer a preloaded question. This can be used in place of flash cards and can force people to do questions through the place that they visit most in a day.

####Concept
Originally created in order to force myself to study when I found that I was procrastinating too much on my phone. The application was intended to not allow me into my phone unless I answered a question. Even if I got it wrong, it would still let me in, but with a delay while telling me the actual answer.

This is still a work in progress and is not complete and can be bypassed. However, so far it has served much of its purpose and actually has been useful.
