####Introduction
This was our (Joon Lee and Brendan Horng) submission to HackRU 2015 Spring. We created a Pebble Hack. If you wish to view the code, it is located at this [Github Repo](http://github.com/Ludusamo/Pebble-Guide).

####Idea

Pebble Guide is an app for the Pebble smartwatch created to help students study. The app contains features such as storing flashcards and scheduling study sessions. In addition, the app features a page dedicated to inspirational quotes to help motivate students to do there best!

####The Struggle

While working on the project, we faced a lot of difficult challenges. This event was a time of many first's. This was the first time we worked togethr in a project as big as this. This was also the first time using the Pebble API and the C programing language. As a result, the project involved a lot of trial and error, but we're satisfied that our project came very close to our intiial idea. 

####The Experience
As we mentioned before, this was a learning experience for the both of us, but it was a very rewarding experience as well. It was exhilerating overcoming coding obstacles. There were many tears, many hugs, and many cheers. At times it was a struggle, but ultimately we came out with more experience, knowledge, and a finished product.
