            <h4>More About Ludusamo</h4>
            <p>Ludusamo is an entity created by Brendan Horng. Ludusamo aims to create a multitude of different applications and programs. Ludusamo first came into existence in 2012 when Brendan wanted to start creating games and applications.</p>
	    <p>Though games were the first intention when creating Ludusamo, it has become the entity in which a lot of different types of programs are published. These include some that are simple utility and others that are for scientific purposes.</p>
	    <p>The name Ludusamo comes from two words in Latin: Amo and Ludus. The former is the conjugation of the Latin word amare which means "I love", and the latter is the Latin word for game. Though not gramatically correct, the two came together as Ludusamo to signify the love of games and enjoyment of such experiences.</p>
