## Happy Holidays Everyone!
Today started out as a pretty nice day with nice weather, but it quickly turned cold huh.

Had a fun time out in the city with my family and meeting up with my aunt and uncle. We tried a new ramen shop called [Hide-Chan Ramen](http://www.hidechanramen.com). Definitely would recommend, and they had one of the best karaage and takoyaki that I have had in the city.

We went walking for a bit and ended up parting at Times Square but not before taking many pictures.

** Yes I know this picture is not in Times Square. It was one we took earlier.

This was another fantastic Christmas and I hope for many more to come.
