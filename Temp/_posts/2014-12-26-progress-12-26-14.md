## Today's Progress
Finally stopped being lazy enough to make some progress on this project. Today I moved along to implementing basic platforming elements. Our character is able to jump and walk around. Collision against the tiled map was also added.

## Issues
Biggest issue today (and still is a small issue) is handling collision in such a way that allows the character to move separately on each axis.

However, the way I compensated was by moving the character to the spot where it wants to go, checking if it would collide with anything, and compensating from there. This resulted in me having to move it very close to the collision if it did end up colliding.

This works out very well... if you can only move in one axis at a time. But since I want the character to be able to move freely, an issue still arises is that, in the instance that the player collides in one axis, the other is being checked right after. So, while it is still clipped into the surface on one axis, it tries to move in the other axis causing it to unnecessarily compensate and "jump" to a "safe" spot.

Tomorrow's task is definitely to try and work this out as I don't want this to be around when I am moving forward.

## Tasks Completed
On the bright side, we got a lot done today.

- Collision is semi-working
- Jumping is implemented
- Basic platforming seems to work fine

Overall, today some good progress was made. Hopefully, if I can solve the last few collision kinks tomorrow, I will start adding animations.
