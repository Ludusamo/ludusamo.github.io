####Vita
Vita was a game created in 48 hours for the 28th [Ludum Dare](ludumdare.com/compo/) Game Competition. It was created using C++, SFML, Aseprite, SFXR, and Pixitracker. The theme for the competition was "You Only Get One".

####Concept
It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
